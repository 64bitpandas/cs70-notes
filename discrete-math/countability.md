# Countability

Injection: one-to-one $$|A| \le |B|$$

Surjection: onto $$|A| \ge |B|$$

Bijection: both injection and surjection $$|A| = |B|$$ \(important theorem thing\)





Countability

A set S is countable if there is a bijection from S to $$\mathbb{N}$$or a subset of N

Common strategies for proving S is countable:

* Find a bijection from S to N
* Find an injection from S to N, and an injection from N to S
* Enumeration: list all elements of S
