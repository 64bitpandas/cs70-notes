# Polynomials

## Introduction

"I learned this in 4th grade", you say, "and I already know how to do Taylor approximations and binomial expansions and get local minima... what else is there to do?" \(At least that was my first thought ðŸ˜›\)

Turns out, polynomials are super useful in the world of discrete math. Here, we'll cover two applications in discrete space, which are **secret sharing** and **error correction.**

### Important Properties

Gotta do some quick review first! Recall that all polynomials are in the form

$$
a_dx^d + a_{d-1}x^{d-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0
$$

where $$d$$is the **degree** of the polynomial \(highest power\) and $$a_i$$are the **coefficients.**

Polynomials have some nice properties:

* A nonzero polynomial of degree $$d$$has at most $$d$$real roots.
* If we're given $$d+1$$distinct points \(x y pairs\), there is exactly one, unique polynomial of degree $$d$$that goes through all of those points.
