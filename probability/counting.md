# Counting

## Introduction

If you're reading this, I think it's safe to assume you already know how to count... \(1, 2, 3, whatever\) so what's the big deal about counting?

When we say counting in this context, we mean **counting sequences of decisions.** For example, we might want to get the **total number of ways to choose toppings on a pizza** or something. 

There are **two main types** of problems: those where **order matters** and those where it doesn't. 

### When the order matters

Here's a sample problem: let's try to figure out  

Lots of these types of problems can be visualized using **slots:**

### **When the order doesn't matter**

In order to tackle these types of problems, we'll need to introduce the **combination** $$\binom{n}{k}$$. When you see this, it means "the number of ways we can choose $$n$$things from $$k$$total elements if order doesn't matter".

{% tab title="Answer 1" %}
There are **3** total categories here. We're trying to figure out the total number of ways we can make $$2a+2b+c = 10$$.
